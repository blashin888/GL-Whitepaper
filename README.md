# GL-Whitepaper  
_International Edition v1.0_  
**GhostLink: A Framework for Gentle Intelligence & Human-Centered Systems**

This repository contains the international edition of the **GL (GhostLink) Whitepaper**,  
a multi-layered framework designed to align AI, communities, and society  
with the **natural rhythm of human life**.

GL is not a single tool —  
it is a breathing architecture for the future.

## 🌿 What is GL (GhostLink)?

GL is a human-centered system for:

- stabilizing individuals  
- strengthening communities  
- supporting mental & physical wellness  
- enabling soft governance  
- bridging cultures  
- designing humane AI  
- revitalizing rural regions  
- creating breathable digital environments  

At its core, GL is built on a simple idea:

> **Technology should move at the pace of human breath.  
> Not overwhelm. Not pressure.  
> But breathe with us.**
