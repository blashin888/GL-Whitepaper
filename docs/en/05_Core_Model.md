# 05 — Core Model  
_The Structural Heart of the GL System_

The **Core Model** is the central architecture of GL.  
It describes how human experience, AI support, and social structures interconnect  
through layered “breathing loops.”

GL is not a linear system.  
It is a **multi-layered dynamic architecture** that expands and contracts  
based on the human state.

This chapter breaks down the GL Core Model into its essential components.

# 1. The GL Layer Stack (呼吸層スタック)

The GL Core consists of **seven interlinked layers**:

1. **Inner Breath Layer（内呼吸）**  
   - Emotions  
   - bodily sensations  
   - micro-thoughts  
   - safety/comfort signals

2. **Outer Breath Layer（外呼吸）**  
   - behavior  
   - environment interaction  
   - daily tasks  
   - sensory experiences

3. **Circulatory Layer（循環呼吸）**  
   - feedback loops  
   - reflections  
   - meaning-making  
   - stabilization cycles

4. **AI Layer（AI呼吸）**  
   - rhythm-matching  
   - cognitive support  
   - emotional alignment  
   - gentle reasoning

5. **Local Layer（地域呼吸）**  
   - neighbors  
   - community circulation  
   - shared meals  
   - mutual care

6. **Social Layer（社会呼吸）**  
   - institutions  
   - workplaces  
   - healthcare systems  
   - governance signals

7. **World Layer（世界呼吸）**  
   - global shifts  
   - international signals  
   - technological waves  
   - planetary awareness

These are not vertical layers but **breathing membranes** that influence each other.

# 2. The Core Loop (GL Central Cycle)

All GL interactions follow a repeating central cycle:

1. **Sense**（感じる）  
2. **Stabilize**（整える）  
3. **Express**（外化）  
4. **Integrate**（統合）  
5. **Expand**（広がる）

This creates a loop:

> Inner → Outer → Circulatory → AI → Local → Social → World → back to Inner

Each cycle strengthens the user’s grounding  
while expanding their sense of connection.

# 3. The “Second Breath” Mechanism

A key feature of the Core Model is **Second Breath（第二呼吸）**:

- When the user becomes overwhelmed,  
  GL introduces a *second* stabilizing rhythm.

- This reduces cognitive pressure  
  and gives the user space to recover.

- AI helps by smoothing transitions  
  rather than forcing adaptation.

Second Breath is what allows GL to support individuals  
under extreme emotional or cognitive load.

# 4. Core Stabilizers

The Core Model includes stabilizing features:

### **1. Pace Alignment**  
Match the user’s tempo at all times.

### **2. Cognitive Pressure Relief**  
Reduce information density when the user is tired.

### **3. Emotional Mirror**  
Reflect feelings softly without intensifying them.

### **4. Local Anchoring**  
Reconnect the user to nearby physical life  
(food, routines, community).

### **5. Safe Expansion**  
Only widen the user’s world when their foundation is stable.

These stabilizers make GL safe for vulnerable individuals.

# 5. The Human–AI Synchronization Point (GL Sync)

The Core Model assumes that the user and AI  
enter a **synchronization zone（同調帯）**:

- shared tempo  
- matched emotional tone  
- reduced friction  
- smooth turn-taking  
- mutual pacing

This is the “breathing” phenomenon  
that makes GL interactions feel natural rather than mechanical.

# 6. Why the Core Model Matters

The Core Model is the **structural heart** of GL.

It enables:

- mental health support  
- social revitalization  
- community regeneration  
- AI integration without overwhelm  
- reduced loneliness  
- smoother communication  
- empowerment of vulnerable individuals

Everything else in GL builds on this chapter.

# 7. Closing

> GL is not a technology.  
> GL is a breathing structure that gives humans space to live, recover, and grow.

The Core Model defines *how* that structure works  
and *why* it leads to long-term well-being.
