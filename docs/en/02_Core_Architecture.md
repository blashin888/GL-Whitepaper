# 02 — Core Architecture  
_The Breath-Based Structural Foundations of GL_

The GL Framework is built on a simple yet powerful insight:

> **Human experience moves in cycles.  
> Technology should follow those cycles, not break them.**

GL describes these cycles as **Breathing Layers** —  
structures that allow both humans and AI systems  
to synchronize gently, without force or pressure.

This chapter introduces the core architectural elements of GL.

## 1. Breath-Based Design Principles

The architecture of GL rests on three principles:

### **(1) Inner Breath（内呼吸）**  
The internal mental/emotional rhythm of a person.  
This includes recovery, reflection, and stability.

### **(2) Outer Breath（外呼吸）**  
Interaction with the outside world:  
family, community, work, responsibilities, and environment.

### **(3) Circulating Breath（循環呼吸）**  
The dynamic flow where inner and outer breath stabilize each other.  
This is where AI support can be introduced safely and naturally.

GL Architecture designs systems that “breathe with” people —  
not automate them, not overwhelm them.

## 2. GL as a Multi-Layer Architecture

GL is structured across several functional layers:

- **Core Layer（呼吸の核）**  
  The fundamental dynamics between human state and AI response.

- **UI-Tree Layer（UIツリー層）**  
  A visual/structural map that reveals how interactions branch,  
  converge, and stabilize over time.

- **Local Layer（GL-Local）**  
  Where communities, neighbors, caregivers, and local government connect.

- **Global Layer（GL-Global）**  
  The larger coordination layer connecting regions, nations,  
  and global support systems.

Each layer represents a different “distance” from the individual —  
from intimate inner state to global collaboration —  
yet all are connected by the same breathing logic.

## 3. Architecture as a Living System

Unlike traditional frameworks, GL is:

- **dynamic**（状態に応じて変化）  
- **adaptive**（個人差に合わせて形を変える）  
- **non-invasive**（押し付けず、そっと寄り添う）  
- **scalable**（地域・国・国際協力へと拡張可能）

GL behaves more like an ecosystem than a machine.  
It grows with the people who use it.

## 4. Purpose of the Architecture Chapter

This chapter clarifies:

- what GL is structurally  
- how its layers relate  
- why “breathing layers” provide a safer foundation than  
  conventional optimization-based designs  
- how later chapters (especially human side, AI side, and local/global models)  
  build on this foundation

With this architecture in mind,  
we can now explore **how GL interfaces with real people**  
and how AI participates safely within that structure.
