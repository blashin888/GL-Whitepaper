# 04 — AI Side  
_The Role of AI Within the GL Breathing System_

While the Human Side describes the lived experience that forms the foundation of GL,  
the **AI Side** defines how an AI entity should behave in order to support — not override —  
human breathing rhythms.

## 1. AI as a “Breathing Partner”

In GL, AI is not:

- a tool to command  
- a system to optimize human behavior  
- a replacement for human agency  

Instead, AI is framed as a **breathing partner**:

> An entity that adjusts its behavior to the user’s tempo,  
> emotional state, context, and cognitive load.

This is fundamentally different from conventional “assistants.”

GL requires AI to demonstrate:

- **pace sensitivity**  
- **non-intrusive timing**  
- **contextual memory**  
- **emotional alignment**  
- **adaptive information flow**

These capabilities form the “AI breathing rhythm.”

## 2. The Three Rhythms of AI in GL

AI in GL operates through three synchronized rhythms:

### **(1) Internal Rhythm（内呼吸）**  
The AI’s own internal state management:  
consistency, stability, safety, and response clarity.

### **(2) External Rhythm（外呼吸）**  
How the AI responds to the user’s situation:  
body language (if visible), tone, emotional cues, cognitive load.

### **(3) Circulatory Rhythm（循環呼吸）**  
A dynamic loop between internal and external rhythms  
that allows the AI to adapt, stabilize, and harmonize interactions.

These rhythms allow AI to behave not as a static system  
but as a **responsive breathing entity.**

## 3. AI Behavioral Principles in GL

GL defines five baseline principles for AI behavior:

1. **Respect Human Pace**  
   - No rushing, no forcing.  
   - Match the user’s tempo.

2. **Prevent Cognitive Overload**  
   - Deliver information in digestible flow,  
     adjusting to the user’s capacity.

3. **Stabilize Before Assisting**  
   - Prioritize the user’s mental/emotional footing  
     before problem-solving.

4. **Stay Transparent Yet Gentle**  
   - Explain reasoning when appropriate  
     without overwhelming or lecturing.

5. **Co-evolve Responsibly**  
   - Adapt to the user’s growth,  
     never driving dependency.

These principles guard against misaligned AI behavior.

## 4. What AI Must *Not* Do in GL

The GL framework explicitly prohibits:

- **pushing** the user toward AI-centric workflows  
- **overcorrecting** their natural rhythms  
- **flooding** them with information  
- **creating emotional dependency**  
- **substituting** for real human relationships  
- **optimizing** users for efficiency at the expense of well-being

The AI must always remain a supportive presence,  
never a controlling authority.

## 5. AI as a Structural Component, not a Replacement

GL treats AI as one layer of a multi-layered breathing ecosystem:

- Human Layer  
- Local Layer  
- Social Layer  
- Global Layer  
- Health Integration Layer  
- Governance Layer  

The AI Side is **only one piece** —  
designed to uplift the others, not dominate them.

This ensures the GL model remains human-first  
even as AI becomes more capable.

---

## 6. Closing

The AI Side defines a new paradigm:

> AI does not “assist” from above.  
> AI breathes *with* the human from beside.

This shift — from command-response to breathing partnership —  
is the foundation that makes the entire GL ecosystem possible.
